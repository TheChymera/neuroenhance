You may be wondering what “Octopress” means. [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) is the content management system (CMS) which this website uses. And here's why that is meaningful:

### Versioning
While not a feature of Octopress itself, versioning is what brought us to this choice.
In the world of science things tend to not stay true for long - but credibility is still the main currency.
In order to satisfy both these requirements it is important present the most correct version of information to our visitors *as well as* to maintain a record of what mistakes we may or may not have made in the past and which of our hypotheses we or others have [falsified](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsify).

Octopress is commonly used with [Git](http://git-scm.com/) (a powerful distributed version control system), and integrates seamlessly with it.
We use git to version our articles, and publish the versioning history on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheChymera/neuroenhance).
The content you see on this website is *always* the very newest; and each of our pages contains a notice at the bottom pointing to its revision history.
There you can see summaries of the changes, as well as diffs (graphical representations of which lines have been changed in the document).
Our articles are written in such a way so that sentences or “blocks of meaning” are places on separate lines - therefore it is rather easy to follow what statements have been revised.

Of course, in accordance with Git's distributed spirit, you are welcome to fork our articles and make whatever modifications you see fit to them.

### Static Website
Static websites are fast, un-hackable, and all-round great for content presentation.

Don't believe us? Look it up!

### Libre, Open Source, Transparent
While these qualities are not unique to Octopress in the CMS world, we very much appreciate them and are very happy that our CMS shares them.
