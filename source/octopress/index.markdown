You may be wondering what “Octopress” means. [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) is the content management system (CMS) which this website uses. And here's why that is meaningful:

### Versioning
While not a feature of Octopress itself, versioning is what brought us to this choice.
In the world of science things tend to not stay true for long - but credibility is still the main currency, and suitability for citation indispensable.
In order to satisfy these requirements it is important present the most recent (and thus, most correct) version of information to our visitors *as well as* to maintain a record of our revisions.
That record should allow insight into which of our hypotheses we or others have [falsified](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsify), and in light of what developments it was done so.

{% codeblock History of this page: %}
https://github.com/TheChymera/neuroenhance/commits/master/source/octopress
{% endcodeblock %}

Versioning should also allow users to cite a stable version via a link which will remain unmodified in both content and address over time.

{% codeblock Static link to a previous revision of this page: %}
https://github.com/TheChymera/neuroenhance/blob/4c4e389a77a35fb51861c0b6479c39942ea3748e/source/octopress/index.markdown
{% endcodeblock %}

Octopress is commonly used with [Git](http://git-scm.com/) (a powerful distributed version control system), and integrates seamlessly with it.
We use git to version our articles, and publish the versioning history on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheChymera/neuroenhance).
The content you see on this website is *always* the very newest; and each of our pages should contain a notice at the bottom pointing to its revision history.
There you can see summaries of the changes, as well as diffs (graphical representations of when what lines of a document have been changed).
Our articles are written in such a way that sentences or “blocks of meaning” are placed on individual lines 
- this makes it easier to follow what statements have been revised.

Of course - in accordance with Git's distributed spirit - you are welcome to fork our articles, modify them, and even submit pull requests
(that means as much as asking us to integrate one of your revised versions back into our blog).
Please do not forget to abide by our [license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) if you are publishing modified versions of our content anywhere else.

### Static Website
Static websites are fast, un-hackable, and all-round great for content presentation.

### Libre, Open Source, Transparent
While these qualities are not unique to Octopress in the CMS world, we very much appreciate them and are very happy that our CMS shares them.
