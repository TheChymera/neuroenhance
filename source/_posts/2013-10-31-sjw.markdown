St. John's Wort is a widely known herbal remedy for depression, which has been [used for millennia][pöldinger2000].
This plant is very interesting as a [neuroenhancer](http://www.neuroenhance.chymera.eu/neuroenhancement/) as it has a desirable profile of psychotropic effects, has been identified in [a broad review of studies][linde2008] as superior to placebo, and is available in most parts of the world legally over the counter.

In the eyes of some, St. John's Wort may bear additional appeal for being natural and non-refined.
We would like to mention that attributes such as *natural*, *non-processed*, or *organic* [do not equate with *safe*, *reliable*, or *good*][posadzki2013].
Herbal medicines are often referred to by the plant's name and administered as such simply because the active ingredients are not accurately identified.
To the serious researcher and the informed consumer this should be a reason for additional scrutiny rather than a word of praise.

##Psychotropic Effects
There are no scientific reports of St. John's Wort effects on non-depressive populations.
We would like to note that the plant's psychotropic effects are not acute and take about one week of regular consumption (~900 mg daily) to develop.
Based on anecdotal and auctorial experience we report similar effects as in depressive disorder patients:

* Overall mood improvement
* Increased motivation
* Light-headedness

In clinical trials, St. John's Wort compares favourably with placebo - and is especially [effective in the treatment of mild to moderate depression][kasper2010].
Its use has high prevalence in German-speaking countries, and it is [often prescribed by psychiatrists in Germany][dörks2013], especially to adolescents.
St. John's Wort also finds additional clinical or peri-clinical usage in:

* [Treating Anxiety disorders][sarris2013]
* [Aiding with Smoking cessation][camfield2013]
* [Treating Premenstrual dysphoric disorder][rapkin2013]

Additionally, acute (immediate) antidepressant and stimulant effects have been [found in animal models][bukhari2013].

##Non-Psychotropic Effects
The non-psychotropic effects of St. John's Wort have a more immediate onset than the psychotropic ones.
The most prominent of these are:

* Analgesia - especially against migraine, demonstrated at least in [animals models][galeotti2013].
* Mild [antiviral][birt2009] and [topical antibacterial][saddique2010] properties.
* [Photosensitization][schey2000].

##Pharmacology
As an unrefined herbal produce, St. John's Wort contains a plethora of active constituents (further documented in [this study][nahrstedt1997] and more recently in [this study][ma2012]).
[Research indicates][butterweck2003] that [**hypericin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypericin) and [**hyperforin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperforin) are the main active ingredients of St. John's Wort.

Compared to most antidepressants St. John's Wort exhibits [a very broad mechanism of action][butterweck2003]
(inhibiting the reuptake of at least [serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine, GABA, and L-glutamate][wonnemann2001]).
This mechanism of action [is credited mainly to hyperforin][chatterjee1998].
This substance [is believed][müller2003] to inhibit the reuptake of a large number of neurotransmitters by decreasing the sodium-gradient which many neurotransmitter transporters rely on for function.

As with many other plants, the pharmacological efficacy of St. John's Wort varies strongly from cultivar to cultivar, and closely related plants [have closely related pharmacological profiles][stojanović2013]. 

##Safety
Literature reviewers rate the integrated incidence and severity of (undesirable) side effects as low, and [recommend St. John's Wort as **safe**][ernst1998].
This view is apparently shared by many legislators who impose no or little restrictions on commercialization of the herb.

We would - however - like to remind neuroenhancement enthusiasts that the cocktail of chemicals in this herb could have potentially displeasing interactions with other neuroenhancers.
Though we very strongly advise against using St. John's Wort in conjunction with the drugs listed below, [this study][rahman2013] suggests that the practice of using it together with antidepressants is not unheard of.
We have compiled a short list of potentially dangerous interactions (which we do not claim is exhaustive):

* **[5-HTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-HTP)** - this substance increases 5-HT production, and can lead to **serotonin syndrome** if used in conjunction with substances with 5-HT reuptake- or degradation-inhibiting activity (which some SWJ constituents posess).
* **[SSRIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSRI)** - these substances inhibit 5-HT reuptake and include many antidepressants (e.g. fluoxetine, citalopram, or sertraline); practically extracellular 5-HT concentrations would also be exacerbated in this constellation, again potentially leading to **serotonin syndrome**.
* **[SSNRIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSNRI)** - these substances inhibit 5-HT as well as norepinephrine reuptake and could *additionally* interact with St. John's Wort on the norephrinergic front and cause anxiety, hypertension, and tachycardia. 
* **[MAOIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAOI)** - these substances would share the same negative interactions with St. John's Wort [as with SSNRIs][cymbalta] (since the main action mechanism of SWJ seems to be wide-range monoamine reuptake inhibition).
* The half-life of very many drugs is strongly diminished by St. John's Wort - since it [increases the activity of cytochrome P450, which degrades at least 50% of marketed medications][markowitz2003]. This could protect against some interactions, but also put people who are taking antibiotics, contraceptives, etc. at risk.

Sadly it seems drug-drug interactions for St. John's Wort are [not extensively clinically studied][russo2013].
If you have reliable sources or personal experience backing additional negative interactions (or refuting any of the ones we have listed) please comment, [contribute](http://www.neuroenhance.chymera.eu/interact/), or contact us!

##Where can I get this?
For responsible and informed neuroenhancement enthusiasts who have read the above and are observing our safety notes, we have researched convenient means of procuring St. John's Wort.
It is available legally over the counter in most of the world, though preparations and potency (as with many herbal produces) vary greatly.
Different preparations should be tried out to determine which ones bear the greatest efficacy on any one consumer.
The most affordable way to get a preparation which others may have reviewed and you can in turn review is online.
Here is a list with adequate and affordable options for a number of countries:
