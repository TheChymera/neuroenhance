Neuroenhancement - as understood on this blog - is the practice of enhancing the mind, regardless of what aspects of the mind are meant, what practices are being used, and what side-effects these practices may have.

Let us elaborate a bit on these three points:

* **Any aspects of the mind** - In many media reports the term neuroenhancement is used exclusively in liaison with unprescribed consumption of nootropics. While improving learning is an interesting aspect of neuroenhancement - it is no less *neuro* and not less of an *enhancement* to improve how good the mind is at *anything else* it does. This could include sleeping, relaxing, socializing, dancing, talking - and, just to drive the point home - *not* learning (which you might be interested in if you find yourself in a situation which you would not like to have a lasting impression of in your mind).

* **Any mind-influencing practices** - Neuroenhancement is a media-darling for passionate debate about how scientific advances make the moral fiber of society unravel. The term has thus accumulated a connotation of being something inherently modern and game-changing. However, the desire for a better mind is by no means a recent development. Some means of enhancing our minds are quite recent, but people have done it with whatever means they had in the past. Just to list a few examples of neuroenhancement methods with a longer history than the commonly discussed psychotropic pharmaceuticals: some psychotropic substances (e.g. cathionin), meditation, mnemonic devices, psychotherapy, and - of course - education.

* **Any side-effects** - A very common belief states that the mind is already in a *definitive, perfect* equilibrium, and that there is no way to make it *better*. For a short rebuttal it would suffice to say that in the world of biology there is no such thing as a *definitive, perfect* state and no measure of *better*. What is however true is that enhancing the mind on one front often weakens it on another. Not based on any particular experiment, but just for the sake of an example: It may be difficult to relax while heightening your energy; or you may find it difficult to dance while heightening your learning capabilities. Still, you do not need to add or subtract any fanciful measures of *worse* or *better* to determine if you are truly enhancing your mind. If your mind does the specific task you want to do with it at the respective moment and outperforms itself at it according to whatever criteria you deem meaningful (speed, accuracy, etc.) - then what you are practicing is neuroenhancement.
