Neuroenhancement - as understood on this blog - is the practice of enhancing the mind, regardless of what aspects of the mind are meant, what practices are being used, and what side-effects these practices may have.

Let us elaborate a bit on these three points:

* **Any aspects of the mind** - 
In many media reports the term neuroenhancement is used exclusively in liaison with [unprescribed consumption of nootropics][repantis2010]. 
While [improving learning][levinson2013] is an interesting aspect of neuroenhancement - it is no less *neuro* and not less of an *enhancement* to improve how good the mind is at *anything else* it does. 
This could include sleeping, relaxing, socializing, dancing, talking - and, just to drive the point home - *not* learning 
(which might be interesting in situations which you would not like to have a lasting impression of in your mind).

* **Any mind-influencing practices** - 
Neuroenhancement is a popular media theme for passionate debate about how scientific and technological advances make the moral fiber of society unravel. 
The term has thus accumulated a connotation of being something inherently modern and game-changing. 
However, the desire for a better mind is by no means a recent development. 
[Some means][clark2013] of enhancing our minds are indeed quite recent, but people have practiced neuroenhancement in the past via whatever methods they had. 
Just to list a few examples of mind enhancing methods dating back longer than psychotropic pharmaceuticals and brain stimulation: 
psychotropic plants (e.g. [khat][giannini1986] or the [tea plant][bennett2001]), meditation, mnemonic devices, psychotherapy, and - of course - education.

* **Any side-effects** - 
A very common belief states that the mind is already in a *definitive, perfect* equilibrium, and that there is no way to make it *better*. 
For a short rebuttal it would suffice to say that in the world of biology there is no such thing as a *definitive, perfect* state and no measure of *better*. 
What is however true is that enhancing the mind on one front often weakens it on another. 
Not based on any particular experiment, but just for the sake of an example: 
It may be difficult to relax while heightening your energy; or you may find it difficult to dance while heightening your learning capabilities. 
Still, you do not need to add or subtract any fanciful measures of *worse* or *better* to determine if you are truly enhancing your mind. 
If your mind does the specific task you want to do with it at the respective moment and outperforms itself at it according to whatever criteria you deem meaningful (speed, accuracy, etc.) - then what you are practicing is neuroenhancement.
